## The Elephant in the Room

Yes, Lithuanian has 7 grammatical cases. This means the ending of a noun changes depending on its job in the sentence. It sounds scary, but English has a tiny bit of this too (Review: He vs. Him).

## Why endings change (Context is King)

In English, word order tells you who does what ("Dog bites man" vs "Man bites dog"). In Lithuanian, the _endings_ tell you who does what, so the word order can be flexible.

## The Big 3 for Beginners

Focus on these first:

1.  **Nominative (Vardininkas):** The Subject (Who?). Dictionary form.
    Ex: _Kava_ (Coffee) is mostly nominative.
2.  **Genitive (Kilmininkas):** Usage/Possession/Of/After "No".
    Ex: _Puodelis kavos_ (Cup of coffee). _Noriu kavos_ (I want coffee).
3.  **Accusative (Galininkas):** The Object (Receive action).
    Ex: _Geriu kavą_ (I drink coffee - notice the ą).

## Quick Practice

**Mama** (Subject) myli **tėtį** (Object - Tėtis changes to Tėtį).
Mom loves dad.
