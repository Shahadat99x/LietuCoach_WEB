# Why Go Offline?

We rely on Google Translate too much. When the data cuts out (in a forest, on a plane, or in a basement bar), we panic.
Learning offline builds **true resilience**.

## 1. Download Content _Before_ You Leave

Most apps require data. Ensure you have:

- Offline dictionary (dict.cc is good).
- PDF cheat sheets.
- **LietuCoach App** (Entirely offline-first).

## 2. Talk to Yourself (The Shadowing Method)

You don't need Wi-Fi to speak.

- narrate your life: "Dabar aš einu." (Now I go.) "Tai yra stalas." (This is a table.)
- It sounds crazy, but it connects the Lithuanian words to physical objects, not just English translations.

## 3. Journaling in "Spanglish" (Lit-glish?)

Write your daily journal. If you don't know a word, write it in English but use Lithuanian grammar structure.

- _Aš (go) į (shop)._
  Later, look up the missing words.

## 4. Paper Flashcards

Old school? Yes. Effective? Absolutely.
Writing a word by hand boosts memory retention by up to 25% compared to typing.

## Conclusion

Internet is a luxury. Your brain is reliable. Train it to work without a signal.
