Moving to Vilnius is exciting. The baroque architecture, the tech scene, the coffee culture... but then you walk into a Maxima supermarket and realize you don't know which carton is milk and which is kefir. (Hint: _Pienas_ is milk, _Kefyras_ is kefir).

## Why English is common but Lithuanian connects

Yes, many young people in Vilnius speak excellent English. You can survive without Lithuanian. But to _thrive_? To make local friends? A few phrases go a long way.

## Public Transport (Vilniečio kortelė)

You'll need a card or the app (m.Ticket). Look for words like **Stotelė** (Stop) and **Tvarkaraštis** (Timetable).

## Supermarket Survival

*   **Akcija** - Sale/Discount (Your favorite word).
*   **Duona** - Bread.
*   **Vanduo** - Water.

## Setting up Internet/Gym

These contracts can be tricky. Look for **Sutartis** (Contract) and **Mėnesinis mokestis** (Monthly fee).
