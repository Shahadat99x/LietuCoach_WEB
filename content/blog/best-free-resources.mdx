# Learning Used to Be Hard

Ten years ago, there were almost no resources for Lithuanian. Now, we are lucky.

## 1. LietuCoach (Best for Offline/Speaking)

Okay, we are biased. But for **offline practice** and **audio-first learning**, we built this specifically because gaps existed.

- **Pros:** Offline, native audio, focus on pronunciation.
- **Cons:** It's an app, not a grammar textbook.

## 2. LRT Mediateka (Best for Immersion)

The national broadcaster (LRT) puts everything online.

- **Tip:** Watch "Gustavo Enciklopedija" (kids show) or news summaries.
- **Pros:** Authentic, high quality.
- **Cons:** No subtitles usually. Hard for A1.

## 3. Debesyla (Best for Grammar)

A fantastic blog about Lithuanian grammar and lifestyle.

- **Pros:** Deep dives into grammar rules.
- **Cons:** Can be overwhelming for total beginners.

## 4. YouTube Channels

- **Lithuanian Out Loud:** The classic podcast. Hundreds of episodes.
- **Talk Like Antanas:** Good basic phrases.

## How to Build a Routine (Free)

1.  **Morning:** 5 mins LietuCoach (Vocab).
2.  **Commute:** 1 Episode Lithuanian Out Loud.
3.  **Evening:** Read 1 article on LRT (use Google Translate for help).

## Conclusion

You don't need expensive courses. You need consistency and the right mix of tools.
