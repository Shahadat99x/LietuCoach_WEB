# The "First Contact" Jitters

Your heart beats fast. You approach the checkout. You are about to speak Lithuanian.
Preparation is the antidote to fear.

## The Scripted Method

Don't improvise. Actors don't improvise their first show.

### Phase 1: The Opener

- **Sveiki.** (Hello).
- Keep eye contact. Smile.

### Phase 2: The Core Request

Keep it short. Nouns + "Prašom".

- _Vieną kavos, prašom._
- _Šitą, prašom._ (This one, please - pointing is fine!)

### Phase 3: The "Panic Button"

If they ask a complex question ("Ar turite nuolaidų kortelę?"):

- **Atsiprašau, aš nesuprantu.** (Sorry, I don't understand).
- **Ne.** (No - usually a safe bet for extra offers).

### Phase 4: The Exit

- **Ačiū, viso gero.** (Thanks, bye).

## Practice Drill

Before you go in:

1.  Visualize the interaction.
2.  Say your lines out loud to yourself 3 times.
3.  Visualize them smiling back.

## Why This Matters

Your first conversation isn't about transferring information. It's about breaking the ice. Once you realize you didn't die, the second conversation becomes 50% easier.

## Conclusion

Script it. Rehearse it. Do it. Celebrate.
