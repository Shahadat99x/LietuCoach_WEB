# Lithuanian Stress and Intonation

If you've listened to Lithuanian, you might have noticed it has a "singing" quality. This comes from its pitch accent system. But don't panic! As a beginner, you just need to know where to put the stress (the "loud" part of the word).

## The Golden Rule: Stress is Flexible

Unlike Polish (usually second-to-last syllable) or French (last syllable), Lithuanian stress is **free**. It can fall anywhere.

- **Labas** (Hello) — Stress on the first syllable: **LA**-bas.
- **Dėkui** (Thanks) — Stress on the first syllable: **DĖ**-kui.
- **Lietuva** (Lithuania) — Stress on the last syllable: Lie-tu-**VA**.

## Why It Matters

Moving the stress can sometimes change the meaning, but usually, it just sounds "foreign."

### Example: "Namas" vs "Namie"

- **Namas** (House): Stress is on the first syllable. **NA**-mas.
- **Namie** (At home): Stress shifts to the end. Na-**MIE**.

## Quick Practice

Try saying these loudly. The bold part is stressed.

1. **A**-čiū (Thank you)
2. Pra-**šom** (Please / You're welcome)
3. **Ka**-va (Coffee) — Wait! Actually, it's often heard as Ka-**VA** in standard, but colloquial speech varies. Standard is Ka-**VA**.
4. Sta-**telė** (Bus stop)

## Intonation Patterns

### Statements

Drop your voice at the end.
_Aš noriu kavos._ (I want coffee.) ↘

### Questions

Raise your voice at the end for Yes/No questions.
_Ar tu nori kavos?_ (Do you want coffee?) ↗

## Mini FAQ

### Do I need to learn stress marks?

Not yet. In dictionaries, you'll see tildes (˜) and acute accents (´). As an A1 beginner, just listen and mimic.

### Will people understand me if I stress the wrong syllable?

Usually, yes! Context is king. Don't let fear of stress stop you from speaking.
