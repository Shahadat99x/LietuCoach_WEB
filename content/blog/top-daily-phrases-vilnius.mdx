# The Vilnius Survival Kit

Vilnius is an international city, but speaking the local language unlocks a deeper level of the city (and better service!).

## Politeness Essentials

1.  **Ačiū / Dėkui** (Thanks). Use _Ačiū_ everywhere.
2.  **Prašom** (Please / Here you go / You're welcome). The "Swiss Army Knife" word.
    - Offering a seat? _Prašom._
    - Answering "Thanks"? _Prašom._
    - Asking for something? _Kavos, prašom._
3.  **Atsiprašau** (Excuse me / Sorry).
    - Bumping into someone? _Atsiprašau._
    - Asking a question? _Atsiprašau..._

## Shop & Café

4.  **Ar galima kortele?** (Can I pay by card?)
    - Vilnius is 99% cashless, but asking is polite.
5.  **Sąskaitą, prašom.** (The bill, please.)
6.  **Čia išsinešimui.** (For takeaway / To go.)
    - Very useful for coffee!

## Directions

7.  **Kur yra...?** (Where is...?)
    - _Kur yra tualetas?_
    - _Kur yra stotelė?_

## Fun Extras

8.  **Geras!** (Good! / Cool! / Wow!)
    - Reacting to a story? Just say _Geras!_
9.  **Nu** (Well / So / Yes / No).
    - Borrowed from Slavic, used by everyone informally. It helps you sound local, but use with caution in formal settings!

## Conclusion

Master these 9 phrases, and you navigate 90% of daily interactions smoothly.
