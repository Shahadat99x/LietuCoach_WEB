# The Shadowing Technique

Many beginners think, _"I can't practice speaking because I don't have a Lithuanian friend."_

Wrong! You can use **Shadowing**. It's used by polyglots everywhere to master intonation and speed.

## How to Do It (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Find native audio (with text)

You need a recording of a native speaker and the transcript. (The LietuCoach app is perfect for this, but podcasts work too).

### 2. Listen first

Listen to the sentence once to understand the rhythm.

### 3. Speak _simultaneously_

Play the audio again and try to say the words **at the exact same time** as the speaker. Do not wait for them to finish. You are a shadow, moving with them.

### 4. Record and Compare

Record voice notes of yourself. Compare it to the original. Are you too slow? Is your intonation flat?

## Why It Works

- **Muscle Memory:** Your mouth gets used to the shapes of Lithuanian sounds.
- **Speed:** It forces you to speak at a natural pace, not the slow "student" pace.
- **Intonation:** You naturally copy the rise and fall of the voice.
