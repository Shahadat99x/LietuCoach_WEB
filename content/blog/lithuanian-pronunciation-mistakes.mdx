Lithuanian pronunciation is actually quite consistent once you know the rules. But beginners often fall into a few traps.

## 1. The "Ačiū" Trap

It looks like "A-see-you", but it's pronounced **Ah-choo** (like a sneeze!).

## 2. Short vs. Long Vowels

U and Ū are different. I and Y are different.
**Butas** (Apartment) vs **Būtas** (Past). Okay, maybe context helps, but try to stretch those long vowels!

## 3. Ignoring the "Check Marks" (š, ž, č)

These are not optional decorations! **S** is "s", but **Š** is "sh". Mixing them up changes the meaning entirely.

## 4. Stress Placement

Lithuanian stress is free-moving. It can move from the start of the word to the end depending on the case. Only listening practice helps here.

## 5. The Soft "L"

Lithuanian 'L' is often softer than the heavy English 'L' (as in "ball"). Think of the 'L' in "leaf".
