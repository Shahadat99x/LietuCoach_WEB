## It's Latin-based (mostly!)

Good news: Lithuanian uses the Latin alphabet, just like English. You won't need to learn a whole new script like Cyrillic or Greek. However, we have a few extra friends that bring specific sounds.

## The "Nosinės" (ą, ę, į, ų)

These letters have a little "tail" or hook at the bottom called a _nosinė_. Originally, these indicated a nasal sound, but in modern standard Lithuanian, they simply make the vowel **long**.

*   **ą** sounds like the _a_ in "father" (long).
*   **ę** sounds like the _a_ in "cat" (but longer).
*   **į** sounds like the _ee_ in "sheep".
*   **ų** sounds like the _oo_ in "moon".

## The "Dotless" e (ė)

The letter **ė** is unique. It makes a very specific sound, like the _ai_ in "air" (without the 'r' sound), or a closed "e". It is distinct from **e** (short, like "met") and **ę** (long/open).

## Consonants with hats (č, š, ž)

These are straightforward if you know English:

*   **č** = **ch** as in "cherry".
*   **š** = **sh** as in "shoe".
*   **ž** = **s** as in "pleasure" (or _zh_).

## Quick Practice

Try saying these words:

*   **Ačiū** (Ah-choo) - Thank you.
*   **Šalta** (Shal-ta) - Cold.
*   **Žuvis** (Zhoo-vis) - Fish.

### FAQ

**Q: How do I roll my R?**
A: Lithuanian 'R' is rolled at the tip of the tongue, similar to Spanish or Italian. Practice saying "butter" very quickly!
