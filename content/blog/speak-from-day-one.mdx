# The "I'll Speak When I'm Ready" Trap

"I just need to learn more vocabulary first."
"I need to master the cases first."

Two years later... silence.

## The Truth About Readiness

You will never feel ready. Speaking is a physical sport, not an intellectual one. You can't learn to swim by reading about water. You have to get wet.

## 1. Use "Islands" of Fluency

Don't try to construct complex sentences. Memorize set phrases (Islands) that are 100% correct.

- _Atsiprašau, ar galite padėti?_ (Excuse me, can you help?)
- _Vieną kavos su pienu._ (One coffee with milk.)

Swim from island to island.

## 2. The "3-Second Rule"

When you enter a shop or see a neighbor:
**You have 3 seconds to speak.**
If you wait longer, your brain invents excuses ("They look busy," "My accent is bad").
Just say _Laba diena_. Immediately.

## 3. Embrace the "Foreigner Bonus"

Lithuanians generally _love_ when foreigners try. We know our language is hard.
If you say just _Ačiū_ correctly, you often get a smile.
You are not being judged; you are being appreciated.

## 4. Script Your Interactions

Before making a phone call or ordering, write down exactly what you will say.
Then, practice it 5 times.
Then, do it.

## Conclusion

Courage is a muscle. Exercise it today. Say _Labas_ to the cashier.
