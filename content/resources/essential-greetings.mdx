# Essential Lithuanian Greetings

You can get very far in Lithuania with a smile and a good "Laba diena." Here covers the essentials you'll use every single day.

## The Big Three

### 1. Labas (Hi / Hello)

- **Use when:** Friends, family, children, colleagues you know well.
- **Pronunciation:** **LA**-bas.

### 2. Laba diena (Good afternoon / Hello)

- **Use when:** Strangers, shops, older people, official situations. It literally means "Good day."
- **Pronunciation:** **LA**-ba die-**NA**.

### 3. Viso gero (Goodbye)

- **Use when:** Leaving a shop, ending a formal call.
- **Pronunciation:** Vi-so **GE**-ro.

## Time-Specific Greetings

| Phrase            | Meaning      | When to use     |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :-------------- |
| **Labas rytas**   | Good morning | Until ~11:00 AM |
| **Labas vakaras** | Good evening | After ~6:00 PM  |
| **Labanakt**      | Good night   | Before sleeping |

## "How Are You?"

Lithuanians generally don't ask "How are you?" to shopkeepers (unlike in the US/UK). Even with friends, it's often a real question!

- **Kaip sekasi?** (How is it going?)
- **Kaip gyveni?** (How do you live/are you living?)

**Safe Answer:**

- **Gerai, ačiū.** (Good, thanks.)

## Quick Practice

Imagine you walk into a coffee shop at 10 AM.

1.  **You:** _Labas rytas._
2.  **Barista:** _Laba diena._ (They might say Good Day even in the morning).
3.  **You:** _Kavos, prašom._ (Coffee, please.)
4.  **You (leaving):** _Viso gero._

## Mini FAQ

### Can I just say "Viso"?

Yes! "Viso" is a common short form for "Goodbye."

### Is "Sveikas" also hello?

Yes, "Sveikas" (to a male) or "Sveika" (to a female) implies "Healthy/Greetings." It's friendly but slightly more old-school/formal-friendly than just "Labas."
