# Don't Panic About Grammar

7 Cases. 3 Genders. Participles.
It sounds like a nightmare.
But A1 isn't about perfection. It's about survival.

## Rule 1: Ignore the Plural (mostly)

Focus on singular forms first. Dealing with one apple (_obuolys_) is hard enough. Don't worry about bags of apples yet.

## Rule 2: The "Noriu" (Want) Rule / Genitive

This is the most common "weird" thing for English speakers.
In English: I want **pizza**.
In Lithuanian: Aš noriu **picos**. (Genitive).

Why? Because you want a _part_ of the universal concept of pizza.
Just remember: **Noriu + -os / -o / -a**.

## Rule 3: Negation is Easy

English: I do not understand. (Extraword "do").
Lithuanian: Just add **ne-** to the verb.

- _Suprantu_ (I understand).
- _Nesuprantu_ (I don't understand).
- _Noriu_ -> _Nenoriu_.

## Rule 4: Present Tense is Enough

Forget future ("I will go") and past ("I went").
Just use present tense + time words.

- _Rytoj aš einu į kiną._ (Tomorrow I go to cinema).
  It's not 100% grammatically perfect, but it's 100% understandable.

## Conclusion

You don't need to know _why_ the ending changed to use it. Just mimic correct phrases. Understanding comes later.
