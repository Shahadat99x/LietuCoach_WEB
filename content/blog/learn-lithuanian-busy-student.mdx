# The "No Time" Myth

You are an Erasmus student or working full-time. You have lectures, parties, and exams. Who has time for Lithuanian grammar tables?

**Good news:** You don't need hours. You need _micro-learning_.

## 1. The "Dead Time" Rule

Vilnius traffic can be slow. Use it.

- **Bus ride (20 mins):** Do not scroll Instagram. Listen to one Pimsleur lesson or do 5 minutes of **LietuCoach** audio drills.
- **Waiting for coffee (5 mins):** Review your 5 "Word of the Day" flashcards.

## 2. Learn What You Actually Use

Don't learn "The apple is red."
Learn:

- "One student ticket, please." (_Vieną studento bilietą, prašom._)
- "Can I pay by card?" (_Galiu mokėti kortele?_)
- "Another beer." (_Dar vieną alų._)

## 3. The "Canteen Challenge"

Vilnius University and VGTU canteens are great practice grounds.
**Goal:** Order your lunch entirely in Lithuanian.

- _Laba diena._
- _Kijevo kotletą, prašom._
- _Ačiū._

## 4. Don't Obsess Over Grammar

You will make mistakes. You will use the wrong case ending. **It doesn't matter.**
If you say "Aš noriu kava" (Nominative) instead of "Aš noriu kavos" (Genitive), the barista still gives you coffee.
Accuracy comes later. Communication comes first.

## Quick Summary

1.  Use commute time for listening.
2.  Focus on survival phrases first.
3.  Speak imperfectly every day.
