# Navigating Public Transport

Vilnius has buses and trolleybuses. They are distinct! Trolleybuses have the electric antennas. Here is the vocabulary you need.

## Key Vocabulary

- **Autobusas** — Bus
- **Troleibusas** — Trolleybus
- **Stotelė** — Bus stop
- **Bilietas** — Ticket
- **Stotis** — Station (Train/Main Bus station)
- **Oro uostas** — Airport

## Buying a Ticket

In Vilnius, you typically use an App (m.Ticket / Trafi) or a card (Vilniečio kortelė). Buying from the driver is possible but more expensive and cash-only (sometimes phased out).

- **Kur galiu nusipirkti bilietą?** (Where can I buy a ticket?)
- **Noriu papildyti kortelę.** (I want to top up the card - at a kiosk like Narvesen).

## Asking for Directions

- **Ar šis autobusas važiuoja į centrą?** (Does this bus go to the center?)
- **Kur man išlipti?** (Where should I get off?)
- **Kitas sustojimas** (Next stop) — Listen for this announcement!

## Quick Practice

**Reading the electronic sign:**

- _1G Stotis_ — Fast Bus 1 going to the Station.
- _2 Saulėtekis_ — Trolleybus 2 going to Saulėtekis (University area).

## Mini FAQ

### Do I need to validate my ticket?

YES. If you have a paper card, touch it to the yellow reader. If you use an app, activate the ticket _before_ getting on. Control (Kelevių kontrolė) is strict!

### What is a "mikriukas"?

A minibus. They are less common in central Vilnius now but common in other cities.
